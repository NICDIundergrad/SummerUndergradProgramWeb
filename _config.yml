title: Summer Undergraduate Program for Neuroscience Training
description: The Neuroscience Institute at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine at NYU Langone Health is excited to offer an immersive 10-week summer research training program in neuroscience for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. Students are eligible to apply in their sophomore or junior years. The summer program is focused on providing opportunities for students to engage in basic and/or translational research under the mentorship of experienced researchers and principal investigators and inspire students to attend Graduate School. This program encourages students from socio-economically disadvantaged and historically underrepresented backgrounds to apply. Preference will be given to applicants from non-research-intensive colleges and universities who show a strong commitment towards diversity and inclusion.
